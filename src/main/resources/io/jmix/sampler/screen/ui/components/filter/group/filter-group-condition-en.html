    condition (the default is AND). You can add AND or OR groups to create complex conditions.</p>

<p>A user can create group conditions by selecting <b>Create Group condition</b> in the <b>Add search condition</b>
    dialog. Group conditions can also be defined in the screen XML (<code>groupFilter</code>).</p>

<p>You can open the advanced conditions editor by selecting <b>Edit</b> in the settings drop-down menu.</p>
