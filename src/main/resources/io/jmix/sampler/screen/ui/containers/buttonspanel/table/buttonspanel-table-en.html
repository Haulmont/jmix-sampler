<p><code>ButtonsPanel</code> is a container that streamlines the use and placement of the components (usually, buttons)
    for data management in a table.</p>

<p><code>buttonsPanel</code> element can be located either inside a <code>table</code>, <code>dataGrid</code>, <code>tree</code>,
    or in any other place of a screen.</p>

<p>If the <code>buttonsPanel</code> is located in a <code>table</code>, it is combined with the table's
    <code>pagination</code> component thus using vertical space more effectively. Additionally, if a screen is
    opened as lookup (for example, from the <code>EntityPicker</code> component) the
    buttons panel becomes hidden.</p>
